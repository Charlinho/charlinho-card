# Charlinho's Card

[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/%40charleston.j.campos%2Fcard.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@charleston.j.campos/card)

## Usage

Via npx:

```bash
npx @charlinho/card
```

Not including how to use it globally because I'm not sure why you'd want this as a global command. That'd be creepy.
